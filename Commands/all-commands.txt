A. Azure CLI:
    1. To check if a resource provider was registered (after you click on register for a resource provider, it may not reflect that the provider has been registered or not on the UI despite being registered, 
    work around this delay by checking the status using the following command) or not for the vmss or anything while saving scaling policy: 
        $az provider show --namespace microsoft.insights -o table
    2. To connect to a linux VM instance using AZ CLI (PuTTY is an alternative):
        $az ssh vm --resource-group rg-readit-app --vm-name weather-vm --subscription e850c46c-48ef-4718-b01a-ad2bexamplesub
    3. Az CLI command to build a DockerImage from a DockerFile and upload to ACR:
        $az acr build --image <NAME>>:<TAG> --registry <REGISTRY NAME> --file Dockerfile .
B. .NET SDK:
    1. Package and publish current project folder and store it in a folder called 'published': 
        $dotnet publish -o published
